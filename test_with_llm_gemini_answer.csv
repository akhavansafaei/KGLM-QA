However, there's no single physical building or location where the Inter-American Convention ""resides"".}

What is the capital of canton of Marseille-Belsunce?,['Marseille'],"There is no entity called ""canton of Marseille-Belsunce"" with a capital.  Marseille-Belsunce is a canton (district) within the city of Marseille, which itself is a commune (municipality). Cantons in France don't have separate capitals; they are subdivisions of larger administrative areas.

Therefore, there is no answer to this question in the requested format.
","There is no canton named ""Marseille-Belsunce"".  Marseille is a city, and it's divided into arrondissements, not cantons in the same way as other French departments.  While the name ""Belsunce"" might refer to a quartier (district) within Marseille, it's not a canton with its own capital.  Therefore, there's no accurate answer to the question.

[No Answer]
{The question is based on a flawed premise. Marseille is a city, not a canton.  Cantons are administrative divisions within departments, and Marseille's administrative divisions are arrondissements and quartiers (districts). Therefore, a ""capital"" for a hypothetical ""canton of Marseille-Belsunce"" does not exist.}
